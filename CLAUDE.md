# PART 1: PRODUCT VISION

## Smashbox Product Vision

**The operating system for modern fitness businesses.**

We give gym owners the power of a large enterprise with the simplicity of a startup: manage your operations, build a community, and increase your revenue, all from a single platform that builds member loyalty and makes businesses resilient.

**For owners:** Predictable revenue. Stripe-worthy reliability. A loyalty tool.
**For members:** An Apple-worthy experience. Visible progress. A fitness place they never want to leave.

---

## Target Market

| Segment | Size | Why Smashbox wins |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Traditional gyms** | 50 to 500 members | Need for modern registration, member management, and re-engagement tools to compete with brick-and-mortar stores |
| **CrossFit gyms** | 50 to 200 members | Community-focused, enjoy leaderboards, need WOD/PR tracking, coach visibility is important |

**Not initially targeted:** yoga/Pilates studios (gamification does not fit with brand image), large corporate chains (different sales cycle and needs).

## Owner Experience: Three Pillars

### 1. Operational Simplicity

**One system for everything**
- Members, classes, payments, staff: no more juggling between different tools
- Clear dashboard with daily overview: who's coming, what's due, what needs attention

**Class management**
- Drag-and-drop planning
- Assign coaches to classes (visible to members)
- Capacity limits and automatic waiting lists
- Recurring classes and easy rescheduling

**Registration system**
- QR code scanning (member app or printed card)
- Kiosk mode for reception
- Real-time attendance tracking
- Reporting of absences and late cancellations

**Payment processing**
- Stripe integration: memberships, class packages, single classes, personal training sessions, retail sales
- Automatic recovery of failed payments
- Reminder sequences to preserve revenue
- Clear reports on revenue by source

---

### 2. Loyalty as a System

**Alerts about at-risk members**

Automatic alerts when members show signs of disengagement:
- More than 50% drop in attendance compared to average
- No reservations for more than 14 days
- Failed payment
- Contract expiring within 30 days
- Decrease in engagement score

**Weekly "Members to save" report**
- Priority list of at-risk members
- Suggested actions for each
- One-click communication templates

**Messaging center**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Segmentation | Targeting by status, presence, plan type, risk level |
| Multichannel | Email, push notifications, SMS, integrated app—all in one place |
| Templates | Predefined campaigns: win back, anniversary, milestone, announcement |
| Automation | Behavior-triggered messages (2 weeks missed → automatic contact) |
| Tracking | Open rate, click-through rate, use of offers |

**Example Automated Flows:**

1. **Win-Back Inactive Members**
   - Trigger: Member hasn't checked in for 14 days
   - Condition: Membership is still active
   - Action: Send email "We miss you! Here's 20% off a PT session"
   - Wait: 7 days
   - Action: If still inactive, send SMS reminder

2. **New Member Welcome**
   - Trigger: Member signs up
   - Action: Send welcome email immediately
   - Wait: 3 days
   - Action: Send "Book your first class" email
   - Wait: 7 days
   - Action: Send "Meet our trainers" email

3. **Renewal Reminder**
   - Trigger: Membership expires in 14 days
   - Action: Send renewal reminder email
   - Wait: 7 days
   - Action: If not renewed, send discount offer
   - Wait: 3 days
   - Action: Send final reminder SMS

4. **Birthday Reward**
   - Trigger: Member's birthday is tomorrow
   - Action: Send birthday email with free guest pass

---

### 3. Long-term Resilience

**Revenue forecasts**
- 30/60/90-day revenue forecasts
- Based on active subscriptions, renewal dates, and churn probability
- "If current trends continue, expect €14,200 next month."

**Diversified revenue tracking**
- View revenue by source: subscriptions, class packages, personal training, single classes, retail sales
- Identify sources of revenue that are growing or declining
- Reduce your dependence on a single type of revenue

**Lifetime value analysis**
- Which member segments are the most profitable?
- Which acquisition channels generate long-term members?
- Which types of courses are associated with the longest retention?

**Contract and renewal visibility**
- Upcoming renewal calendar
- Automatic renewal reminders to members
- Flagging members who are likely to unsubscribe upon renewal

**Reliable infrastructure**
- 99.9% availability target
- Automatic backups
- Stripe-level payment reliability
- Designed to scale: start with a single site, grow without changing platforms

---

## Coach Experience

Coaches are often the best lever for customer loyalty. They need to be given the tools that make their work easier and keep their clients coming back.

**Coach dashboard**
- Their upcoming classes
- Their PT clients and session history
- Client progress at a glance

**Program creator**
- Create training programs spanning several weeks
- Assign them to individual clients
- Track completion and progress

**Client information**
- View attendance habits
- Apple Health data (with member permission)
- Notes and session history

**Revenue transparency**
- Tracking of PT sessions provided
- Visibility into revenue distribution
- Payment history

---

## Member Engagement Tiers

| Tier | Visits/Month | % of Typical Gym | Profile |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Super Active** | 16+ | 5-10% | Your champions. Come almost daily. |
| **High Active** | 10-15 | 15-20% | Consistent regulars. 3-4x per week. |
| **Active** | 5-9 | 25-30% | Solid members. 1-2x per week. |
| **Low Active** | 1-4 | 20-25% | Occasional. Risk of fading out. |
| **Dormant** | 0 (last 30 days) | 15-25% | Haven't shown up. High churn risk. |

---

### Detailed Tier Breakdown

#### Super Active (16+ visits/month)

**Who they are:**
- Your gym's core. Almost daily attendance.
- Often training for something (competition, transformation, lifestyle)
- Likely use multiple services (classes + PT + open gym)

**Value to gym:**
- Highest lifetime value
- Word-of-mouth ambassadors
- Community anchors (other members know them)

**Risk:**
- Burnout or injury could cause sudden drop
- If they leave, they take social connections with them

**Actions:**
- Recognize publicly (leaderboards, shoutouts)
- Invite to be ambassadors or beta testers
- Watch for sudden attendance drops (injury signal)
- Offer leadership roles (help with new members)

**Rewards tier mapping:** Platinum

---

#### High Active (10-15 visits/month)

**Who they are:**
- Consistent 3-4x per week
- Established routine
- Likely have favorite classes/trainers

**Value to gym:**
- Reliable revenue, low churn risk
- Often convert to higher tiers with encouragement

**Risk:**
- Schedule changes (new job, life event) can disrupt

**Actions:**
- Encourage toward Super Active ("You're 2 visits from Platinum this month")
- Feature in community feed achievements
- Offer first access to new classes/programs

**Rewards tier mapping:** Gold

---

#### Active (5-9 visits/month)

**Who they are:**
- 1-2x per week, decent habit
- May not have strong community ties yet
- Often newer members finding their rhythm

**Value to gym:**
- Solid base, room to grow
- Responsive to engagement efforts

**Risk:**
- Habit not fully locked in
- Easily disrupted by life events

**Actions:**
- Encourage consistency ("3 more visits this month for Silver status")
- Suggest workout buddies or community events
- Personalized class recommendations based on preferences

**Rewards tier mapping:** Silver (or working toward it)

---

#### Low Active (1-4 visits/month)

**Who they are:**
- Sporadic attendance
- May have lost motivation or facing barriers
- Often paying but not using membership

**Value to gym:**
- Revenue now, but high churn risk
- "Zombie members" — paying but disengaged

**Risk:**
- Next step is often cancellation
- May feel guilty and avoid gym entirely

**Actions:**
- Proactive outreach ("We haven't seen you in a while — everything okay?")
- Offer low-commitment re-engagement (one class, no pressure)
- Ask about barriers (time, intimidation, goals unclear)
- Suggest PT intro session to reignite motivation

**Rewards tier mapping:** Bronze

---

#### Dormant (0 visits in last 30 days)

**Who they are:**
- Stopped coming entirely
- May have mentally quit but not canceled yet
- Some are seasonal (vacation, travel, illness)

**Value to gym:**
- Revenue at risk
- Recovery possible with right approach

**Risk:**
- Cancellation imminent
- Negative word-of-mouth if they feel ignored

**Actions:**
- Immediate win-back campaign (personal message, not blast)
- Offer pause option instead of cancel
- "We miss you" with specific incentive (free PT session, guest pass)
- If contract ending, prioritize personal call

---

## Member Experience: Four Pillars

### 1. Visible, Personal Progress

Members set their goals and Smashbox automatically tracks all their progress.

**Goal dashboard**
- Choose the type of goal: attendance-based ("3 times a week"), results-based ("lose 5 kg"), or program-based ("complete the 8-week strength training program")
- Visual progress bar: "You have achieved 67% of your goal for the first quarter."
- Weekly review: "You've completed 4 sessions this week, one more than last week."

**Apple Health integration**
- Automatic synchronization: workouts, heart rate, calories, steps, recovery
- History: view your fitness trends over several months

**Achievements and milestones**
- Visual badges: "First 10 classes," "30 consecutive days," "5 a.m. warrior," "Personal best"
- Progress timeline: where you started and where you are today
- Shareable moments: post your achievements on the community news feed

---

### 2. Rewards That Reward Consistency

**Multi-level status system**

| Level | Requirements | Rewards |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Bronze** | Active Member | Basic access |
| **Silver** | 8+ classes/month for 2 months | Priority booking, free guest pass/month |
| **Gold** | 12+ classes/month for 3 months | Exclusive classes, free promotional item, intro PT session |
| **Platinum** | 16+ classes/month for 6 months | Full VIP experience, new class notifications, members' wall recognition |

**Why prioritize non-monetary benefits**
- Priority booking (no extra cost, feeling of privilege)
- Exclusive access to classes (creates scarcity and status)
- Free guest passes (acquisition channel disguised as a reward)
- Merchandise (low cost, high perceived value)
- Public recognition (free, highly motivating)

**Financial rewards reserved for:**
- Recapture campaigns (at-risk members)
- Referral bonuses (acquisition of new members)
- Gifts marking an important milestone (100th class = one month free)

---

### 3. A Community That Creates Belonging

**Community news feed**
- Publicly celebrate members' achievements: "Sarah has just reached 100 classes!"
- Gym announcements by owners
- Class recaps and photos
- Opt-in: members control what is shared

**Leaderboards (opt-in)**

- Series rankings
- CrossFit-specific: WOD times, personal record tracking, benchmark comparisons
- Friendly competition without pressure — always optional

**Workout partners**
- Connect members with similar goals or schedules
- "3 members like you also participate in HIIT on Tuesdays at 6 p.m."
- Encourages accountable partnerships

**Class community**
- Find out who else is enrolled in your class
- Regulars become familiar faces
- Builds relationships that make leaving seem like a loss

---

### 4. Connection with Coaches

**Trainer profiles**
- Photo, biography, specialties, certifications

- "Book a training session" directly from the profile

**Visibility of coaches in classes**
- Each class indicates which trainer is teaching
- Members can filter schedules based on their preferred trainer
- "Follow" a coach to be notified when they are teaching

**Relationship between coach and member**

```

---

## Authentication System

**Type**: Custom session-based authentication (NOT NextAuth)

### How It Works

1. **Login**: User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. **Session Creation**: Server creates a `Session` record in database with unique token
3. **Cookie**: Session token stored in HTTP-only `session` cookie
4. **Validation**: Each request validates session via `getSession()` in `lib/auth.ts`

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` | Session helpers (`getSession`, `getCurrentUser`, `getStaffWithGym`) |
| `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` | Route protection |
| `packages/core/src/services/auth.service.ts` | Auth business logic |
| `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` | Login endpoint |
| `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` | Logout endpoint |

### Route Protection

```typescript
// middleware.ts routes
const publicRoutes = ['/', '/login', '/register', '/member-login', '/member-signup'];
const adminRoutes = ['/dashboard', '/members', '/subscriptions', '/settings'];
const memberRoutes = ['/classes', '/portal'];
```

- **Public routes**: No authentication required
- **Admin routes**: Redirect to `/login` if not authenticated
- **Member routes**: Redirect to `/member-login` if not authenticated
- **API routes**: Not handled by middleware, use `getSession()` directly

---

## Multi-Tenancy

The platform supports multiple gyms with data isolation.

### Tenant Isolation

- Every data model has a `gymId` foreign key
- All queries filter by `gymId` from the authenticated staff's gym
- `getStaffWithGym()` returns staff record with associated gym

### Data Access Pattern

```typescript
// Example: Getting data for current staff's gym
const staff = await getStaffWithGym();
if (!staff) return apiForbidden('No gym access');

const members = await prisma.member.findMany({
  where: { gymId: staff.gymId },  // Always filter by gym
});
```

---

## API Response Format

All API endpoints return a consistent JSON structure:

```typescript
// Success
{
  success: true,
  data: { ... }
}

// Error
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: "VALIDATION_ERROR" | "UNAUTHORIZED" | "FORBIDDEN" | "NOT_FOUND" | "INTERNAL_ERROR",
    message: "Human readable message",
    details?: { ... }  // Optional field-level errors
  }
}
```

### API Helper Functions (`lib/api.ts`)

| Function | HTTP Status | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `apiSuccess(data, status?)` | 200 | Successful response |
| `apiError(error, status?)` | varies | Generic error |
| `apiValidationError(details)` | 400 | Validation failure |
| `apiUnauthorized(message?)` | 401 | Not logged in |
| `apiForbidden(message?)` | 403 | No permission |
| `apiNotFound(message?)` | 404 | Resource not found |

## Deployment (Render)

### Configuration

Deployment is configured in `render.yaml` (Render Blueprint).

```yaml
# Database
databases:
  - name: smashbox-db
    plan: free
    region: oregon

# Web Service
services:
  - type: web
    name: smashbox
    runtime: node
    plan: free
    region: oregon
```

### Build Process

```bash
npm install -g pnpm &&
NODE_ENV=development pnpm install &&
pnpm db:generate &&
pnpm db:push &&
pnpm db:seed &&
pnpm build
```

### Start Command

```bash
pnpm --filter @gym/web start
```

### Environment Variables (Render)

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-linked | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Auto-generated | Session encryption key |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Manual | Production URL |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Environment |
| `NODE_VERSION` | `20` | Node.js version |
| `PORT` | `10000` | Server port |
| `HOSTNAME` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |

### Prisma Binary Targets

For Render deployment (Debian-based), the schema includes:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. Standalone Mode + Prisma + pnpm

**Problem**: Next.js standalone output mode doesn't correctly include Prisma engine files in pnpm monorepos.

**Solution**: Don't use standalone mode. Regular `next start` works correctly.

```javascript
// next.config.js - DO NOT add these:
// output: 'standalone',
// outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),
```

### 2. Render Dashboard vs render.yaml

**Problem**: After code changes, Render may use cached settings from dashboard instead of render.yaml.

**Solution**: Manually update Build Command and Start Command in Render dashboard, or use "Clear build cache & deploy".

### 3. Members API Response Structure

**Pattern**: The members list API returns:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    items: [...],  // Array of members
    meta: { ... }  // Pagination metadata
  }
}
```

When fetching members for dropdowns, access `data.data.items` not `data.data.members`.

## Seed Data

The database seed (`packages/database/src/seed.ts`) creates:

- 1 Demo Gym ("SmashBox Fitness")
- 1 Owner account (`owner@demo.com` / `password123`)
- 3 Membership plans (Basic, Premium, VIP)
- 5 Staff members (various roles)
- 20 Members with subscriptions
- Sample classes (Yoga, HIIT, Spin, etc.)
- Sample payments, invoices, expenses, payouts

## Code Conventions

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- API routes: `route.ts`
- Utils/hooks: `camelCase.ts`
- Schema files: `*.schema.ts`
- Service files: `*.service.ts`

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Typical page component
export default async function PageName() {
  // Server-side data fetching
  const session = await getSession();
  const data = await prisma.model.findMany({ ... });

  return <ClientComponent initialData={data} />;
}
```

### API Route Structure

```typescript
import { prisma } from '@gym/database';
import { getSession, getStaffWithGym } from '@/lib/auth';
import { apiSuccess, apiError, apiUnauthorized, apiForbidden } from '@/lib/api';
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({ ... });

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    const session = await getSession();
    if (!session) return apiUnauthorized();

    const staff = await getStaffWithGym();
    if (!staff) return apiForbidden('No gym access');

    // Check role permissions
    if (!['OWNER', 'ADMIN'].includes(staff.role)) {
      return apiForbidden('Permission denied');
    }

    // Business logic
    const data = await prisma.model.findMany({
      where: { gymId: staff.gymId },
    });

    return apiSuccess(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return apiError({ code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Failed' }, 500);
  }
}
```

## Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd gym-platform

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Set up environment
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# Edit .env.local with your DATABASE_URL

# 4. Set up database
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed

# 5. Start development server
pnpm dev

# 6. Open http://localhost:3000
# Login: owner@demo.com / password123
```

## Future Considerations

- **Stripe Integration**: Models include `stripeCustomerId`, `stripeSubscriptionId`, `stripePayoutId` fields ready for Stripe Connect
- **Email/SMS**: `AutomatedFlow` and `Campaign` models support future email/SMS integration
- **Apple Health**: Member experience pillar requires iOS app with HealthKit integration
- **Mobile App**: API-first design supports future React Native or native mobile clients
- **White Label**: Phase 6 roadmap includes white-label app capability for gyms
